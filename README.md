## Purr Translations
This is an account used to handle Translations made on the [PurrBot Crowding project][crowdin].  
Once a translation is complete will Crowdin push the translated file to the [GitHub Project][github] using this dedicated account for it.

If you would like to help translating the Discord Bot [\*Purr*][website] make sure to read [this little file about how to][info].
